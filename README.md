# ClusterItUp (CIUP) or Cluster Unit Platform (CUP)

## What is this?

CIUP/CUP is a linux distribution that allows sharing the system resources over local network.
The objective of this is to permit the virtualization over distributed system and allow common
operative systems to work over this distributed net of computers.

## Why?

The main idea is to bring a open source OS unit for clustering servers, and to have fun programming :)

## How to use it?

By now this project is being consolidated as a basic linux distribution.

## Can I support with code?

If you get interested in this project and get motivated with contributing code, it would be an honor for sure.
